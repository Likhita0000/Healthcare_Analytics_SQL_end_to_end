# Healthcare_Analytics_SQL_end_to_end

Healthcare Analytics Data Warehouse (SQL Project)

This project focuses on designing and implementing a data warehouse for healthcare data using Microsoft SQL Server.
It follows a structured, multi-layer architecture consisting of Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to manage data from ingestion to analytics.

Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from CSV files using BULK INSERT and stored procedures.

Silver Layer: (In progress) Data cleaning, transformation, and standardization.

Gold Layer: (Upcoming) Exploratory Data Analysis and advanced business analytics — all developed entirely in SQL.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data pipeline built purely with SQL, showcasing database design, ETL workflows, and analytical processing.
A detailed explanation and documentation will be added after the full implementation is complete.
